## 🧱 Architecture

This project uses a **scalable component-service structure**:

```
src/
 ├─ app/
 │   ├─ components/
 │   │   ├─ header/
 │   │   ├─ sidebar/
 │   │   ├─ layout/
 |   |   ├─ action-banner/
 |   |   ├─ invoice/
 │   │   └─ appointment-card/
 │   ├─ pages/
 │   │   ├─ dashboard/
 │   │   ├─ book-new/
 │   │   ├─ history/
 │   │   ├─ forms/
 │   │   └─ profile/
 │   └─ models/
 │       └─ interfaces.interface.ts
 ├─ styles.css
 ├─ index.html
 └─ main.ts
```

Each page has its own `.service.ts` file, making state management modular and testable.
Global layout behavior (like sidebar visibility and routing) is controlled by `LayoutService`.

## 💡 Core Concepts

* **Standalone Components**: Built with Angular’s latest standalone APIs.
* **Reactive Services**: All components communicate through Angular services instead of input/output spaghetti.
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized with flexible grids and media queries down to 320px.
* **Router Animations**: Smooth transitions between routes via Angular animations.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Each page, component, and service has a single responsibility.
